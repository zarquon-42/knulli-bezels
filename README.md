# knulli-bezels

These bezels have been taken from various sources and all credit should go to the
original creators.  If I missed credit please let me know.

For the system bezels I borrowed from https://github.com/nvitaterna/batocera_4_3_handheld_bezels
(which in turn got them from https://github.com/drkhrse/drkhrse_miyoo_bezels and
https://github.com/antiKk/muOS-Overlays) This includes the necessary `.info` files to
make them compatible with Batocera/Knulli. I have swapped some out with the bezels from
stock and adjusted some of the `.info` files.

For the game bezels, I used bezels from [Phanturian](https://www.reddit.com/user/Phanturian/) and
created the necessary `.info` files.

## Installation

Copy the decorations folder to the `userdata` partition of your Knulli SD card. Then, go
to "Game Settings" and set the decoration set to "knulli_4x3_bezels_with_arcade".

You may unset any integer scaling options you may have set for these consoles as the .info
files will set the integer scaling for you (for the systems with int scaling bezels).

and also thanks to [nvitaterna](https://github.com/nvitaterna) for many of the `.info` files.
